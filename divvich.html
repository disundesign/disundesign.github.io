             <h2>Why are we making this app?</h2>
             <p>Technology is rapidly changing how people invest their money, and people can't find a good online space to discuss investments. Despite numerous online investing communities, people still find it's hard to have a constructive discussion.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="myrole">
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I managed UX for a San Francisco fintech startup Divvich which is changing the way people talk about finances. We are a small but knit team worked on Divvich mobile and landing page experience. I led a team of three designers where we drove the design process for the full product lifecycle. The new experience sorts information for investors to quickly help and connect with one another. The landing page experience I designed achieved a 12% conversion rate.</p>

         <div class="business">
               <h2>Business First</h2>
               <p>The first phase of discovery meant identifying our business objectives. What were we trying to do? This slide from our discovery deck lays it all out:</p>

     <div class="metrics">
            <h2>Success Metrics</h2>
            <p>We then translated our goals into quantitative success metrics:</p>

      <div class="personas">
            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>Whenever I begin a research for a project, I typically expect our audience research to help us determine a specific target user with a narrow set of needs to design for. In the case of Divvich, to understand how we might build an app for the investing community, we conducted interviews with people across different investing disciplines and proficiency levels. These personas represent a synthesis of what we found:</p>

            <h2>Learning and analysis</h2>
            <p>Easy enough, however, financial community is not a new idea, why did they fail though or there was not a site that has been wildly successful? We took a hard look on both successful communities and failed ones, then we found what stood in the way. Here are some challenges we are facing: </p>
            <img src="img/competition.png" alt="">
            <p>At this point, we were inundated with information, where should we even start?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="brainstorming">
            <h2>Crafting the framework</h2> 
            <p>In the following weeks, we came together as Designers, PMs, Engineers, Researchers to share what we learned and algn on outcomes. Managing differing perspectives and opinions in any project is challenging. Relying on what we learned through data and research to drive decisions was key to a successful sprint. A key outcome was the alignment of their user pain points that we felt were the highest priority: 1) Quickly sorting out useful info. 2) There is little to none distracting info like Ads. 3) A safe place for constructive conversations. We also walked away with dozens of ideas, finally it's time to execute.</p>

      <div class="sketches">
            <h2>Designing the experience</h2>
            <p>Now that I had a list of tangible ideas and a framework to work with, I was able to start executing. Much easier said than done, of course. The primary goals of this app were to 1) An experience that helps investors find useful information fast. 2) There is none distracting information like Ads. 3) Constructive discussions will be rewarded. I wanted to design a clean, simple experience that would be easy to onboard for new users, have seamless end-to-end flows, and provide personalized views so users didn't have to dig to find what they were looking for. I cycled through pretty much every design methodology and started with locking myself in a room and sketching out some leas...</p>

      <div class="flow">
            <h2>Userflows</h2>
            <p>From there, I finally took a leap into design tools by firing up Figma and piecing together wireframes. When I ran out of momentums, I put together some useflows to give some structures to my thoughts.</p>

      <div class="vision">
            <h2>Implementing the Vision</h2>
            <p>The goals of the design and product experience were to solve for the main themes we uncovered during user research and replicate users' natural processes by building on the framework we outlined: 1) Quickly sorting out useful info. We adopted the successful voting system from reddit which displays posts with highest votes on top.  2) There is little to none distracting info like ads. There are no ads in the community page with a clean visual design, therefore there will be no distractions when you are posting or reading posts. 3) A safe place for constructive conversations with the right moderation. We designed a rewarding system that allows thoughtful posts to earn money, our research showed us that people are less likely to post randomly when there is incentive to earn. </p>

     <div class="learning">
           <h2>Learnings & reflections</h2>
           <p>Lesson one, find the right balance. Throughout the process, we learned how to prioritize user cases. It would take much longer to publish the app if we insisted on building our very own authentication process. Instead, we decided on the solution that to only support Google and FB authorization to start with, this way, we should be able to cover 95% users'needs and reduce 50% of the coding time.  Lesson two, build a diverse team. A team with diverse opinions can help benefit the product in the long run, we are lucky to build a diverse team and avoid some of the common mistakes in the product development process.   </p>
