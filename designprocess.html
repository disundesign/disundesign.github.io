           <h2>01 Research</h2>
           <p>This may be the most crucial step of the design process. Before jumping in, it's important to know what our long term goal is. Why are we doing this? Who will benefit from this? How will this provide a better user experience? To answer these questions, we can create, personas, journey maps, task flows, site maps, user interviews, mind maps, and surveys.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="analysis">
          <h2>02 Analysis</h2>
          <p>After gathering the initial research, working collectively as a team to communicate individual needs, and have conversations about business needs as well as user needs.Getting people involved at this stage helps set the scope for the product and ensure alignment.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="ideation">
          <h2>03 Ideation</h2>
          <p>Once we know what our goal is and we have a roadmap in place, sometimes it's beneficial to set up a design sprint with the rest of the design team. Design sprints can help validate ideas and allow for quick initial test runs through an experience. Collective group brainstorming is an extremely powerful way to do this. I start my brainstorming with pen, paper, and white board. Once I have worked through ideas, I start prototyping digital wireframes in order to validate the framework.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="design">
           <h2>04 Design</h2>
           <p>Once the wireframes have been tested and validated, I'll jump into hi-fi designs. Here I will explore color psychology to understand how we want the users to feel when using the product. Working with UX writers to get the appropriate tone for the product also becomes crucial. I will create mood boards, and come up with a set of visual explorations. If working with other designers, it's good to align on designs and create a consistent and uniform tone and experience. Also, exchanging feedback along the way.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="feedback">
         <h2>05 Feedback</h2>
          <p>Once we have a working prototype, we can conduct user testing to validate the design. Does it solve the problems we were aiming to solve? How is the product being received? Can we improve on this? Does this solve our business goals? Did we discover areas of exploration for a future version?</p>
     </div>
     <div class="implementation">
         <h2>06 Implementation</h2>
         <p>Once the prototype has been locked, development starts. During this process it's important to have on-going check-ins with the development teams. From dogfooding, to A/B testing flights, it's important to monitor progress and be available to any design edits that may need to be addressed along the way. As development is happening, we can start on the next version.</p>
