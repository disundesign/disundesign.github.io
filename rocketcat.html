            <h3>Traditional ways of teaching a language are not personalized enough for the needs of each student.</h2>
            <p>I managed UX for startup RocketCat which is a rapidly growing mobile English-learning platform. English learning in China is largely test driven which is a problem, after user research, we learned that interactive learning can be achieved through AI technology. So I collaborated with visual designers, and designed an experience for English learners to learn English in real context. After months' hard work, we launched on the app store in September 2019, secured $2M seed funding one month after, and are helping thousands of language learners so far.</p>       
            <p class="duration">Duration: 4 months (6 - 9/2019)  |  The RocketCat app released on 9/2019 in China app store.</p>

               <h3>The Problem</h3>
               <p>The way to learn another language seems to be broken, and we try to fix it. Memorizing words from an app or a dictionary is only effective for a very short period of time, and most language education apps fail to help students understand words and use them in real contexts. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
               <h3>Solution</h3>
               <p>Designing an experience for students to learn English in real contexts by creating a user profile for members to keep tracking their learning process and utilizing both video and audio in the teaching process.</p>
          </div>

               <h3>Role and Timeline</h3>
               <p>Taken full ownership of the entire product lifecycle of the project as the lead Product Designer besides the visual design process. Worked with the company management team to deliver actionable steps with some guidance. The duration of the project was completed within a timeline of 5 months.</p>

               <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
               <p>English teaching is a very crowded marketplace in China, so a competitive analysis is very necessary in this case. First and foremost, I began by conducting competitive research to learn about each competitor and do cross-comparisons to define what types of customer segments use their products. In my research, I evaluated Shell, 100, MoMo, and Youdao.</p>

               <p>Next, we look into a product positioning map on how RC will stand out and position itself in the market.</p>

        <div class="empathy">
              <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
              <p>To understand what learners encounter and feel, we started drawing out an empathy map of a learning journey of an average user. In our journey graph, we notice that users feel overwhelmed and confused by vocabulary that has no context.</p>

       <div class="painpoints">
              <h2>Pain Points</h2>
              <p>Through the user interviews and empathy mapping, we were able to understand the pain points of the users.</p>

       <div class="userflow">
              <h2>User Flow</h2>
              <p>I started gathering and sketching my ideas on paper, with tight time constraints and in order to make better wireframes, I made user flows to help me understand deeper about different interactions. The user flow lays out the user movement through the product, mapping out each and every step the user takes from the entry point right through to the final interaction. </p>

       </div>
       <div class="wireframe">
             <h2>Wireframe</h2>
             <p>I created sketches of wireframe, and conducted user testing on these sketches. (1) I reached out to 5 potential users randomly and asked them to test out, and give me their thoughts on my initial sketches. (2) Features that multiple users struggled with were what I focused on next. (3) I refined these sketches in my official wireframes, and even more concretely determined the flow from screen to screen. With validations from students, it's time to bring this app to life. </p>

       <div class="impact">
             <h2> Result and Impact</h2>
             <p> I tested the prototype with several participants to gauge our user's potential receptiveness in the overall functionality of the app based on the scales of visual credibility, familiarity, usability and relevancy. I wanted to ensure if users can successfully use the app and that they see value in it. Some of my participants expressed excitement at having the ability to learn new words through video and audio in an app. After we launched the app, we kept talking to the users, and from their feedback, we believed that we had created a radically better app for learning English vocabulary. (1) Pre-recorded videos to explain English words in real context. (2) Different packages suit different learning needs. (3) Flexibility -users can track and adjust their learning paths very easily. </p>

       <div class="reflection">
             <h2>Learnings & Reflections</h2>
             <p>One of the big lessons I learned from this project is that communication is as important as design itself. As a designer, we are often in the center of information flows. From stakeholders to engineers, it's our responsibility to involve them in our design process in order to bring everyone on the same page. Although design is never done but designers still have to move the needle forward, this is especially true for startups. If we keep chasing that "perfect UX", the product probably would be delayed too long to find its market.  </p>
