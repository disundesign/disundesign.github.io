         <p>Hi, I am Di Sun, an  <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">impact-driven</span>  designer focused on creating  <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">simple and elegant</span>  solutions for complex problems. Currently, I am working as a product designer for  <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">Google</span>  based in San Francisco CA. I majored in photography and transitioned my career to be a designer about 2 years ago. Since then, I've been very fortunate enough to work on really  <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">cool projects</span> . When I am not designing, I'm usually visiting different art museums and trying out different restaurants.</p>
         <p>Every designer and organization has different needs, and therefore different processes. My design process is based on  <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">Lean UX</span> , which emphasizes rapid, iterative UX phases, placing a heavy focus on  <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">team collaboration</span> , user input, and measurable results. Functions overlap, allowing designers and developers to work together from the very start. This process is quick, efficient, accurate, precise, and adaptive. It is custom-tailored to each project, allowing it to yield <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">high quality</span> UX in any circumstance, when applied correctly.</p>
         <p>If you want to know more about my UX process, I constantly write and update my design process page <a href="designprocess.html"><span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">here</span></a>. If you made this far, let's have coffee together to talk about design, art and delicious food. Please feel free to shoot me an email: <span style ="color:#2471E2; font-weight: 400;">sundi73@gmail.com</span> or connect me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/di-sun-34762971/">LinkedIn</a>. </p>
