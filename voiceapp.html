                  <h3>Virtual assistants are nothing new, but why are people hesitant to use them? </h3>
                  <p>  "Jessica" a virtual personal assistant concept app, it can help you accomplish everyday tasks on your phone including find a file or set a to-do list.The reason I want to take on this design challenge is because VUI devices and applications get increasingly popular in recent years, but people are still hesitant to use them for many reasons. I want to dig deeper and find out why, and attempt to make something better. Cathy Pearl from Google has a very good point of view on this matter - "As technology evolves, making digital experiences feel more human becomes more and more essential. After all, innovative new interfaces can only help those who can access and use them."</p>

                 <h3>The Problem</h3>
                 <p>Despite having powerful productivity software, people still find themselves wasting time by performing the same simple tasks over and over again.</p>
                 <h3>Challenges</h3>
                 <p>1. User interface is intuitive and friendly. <br>2. Allowing users to keep or delete their entire search history.  <br>3. Users can choose to delete their data easily. <br>4. Making social media sharing accessible. </p>
                 <h3>My Role</h3>
                 <p>As the sole designer responsible for the concept project,  I conducted multiple rounds of research and produced sketches, wireframes, and mockups. Additionally, I made micro transition animations, iterated again for a final functional prototype.</p>

         <div class="howitwork">
                       <h3>How it works</h3>
                       <p>VUI apps should be a tool not a burden, this is the guiding principle of this project. So naturally, the majority of the app is controlled by voice with few touches needed. Just simply stating what tasks you want your phone to accomplish. Then, "Jessica" offers options for you to review or choose what to do next.</p>

                <h3>Survey & Interviews</h3>
                <p>In the discovery phase, I interviewed my friends, family and coworkers.(These rounds of user testing waere not moderated.) I discovered 3 major issues with the current voice control apps. The first one is data transparency. Users are worried about the privacy of their data. The second issue is functionality, there are some major misuse cases during our test across platforms. I.e. Siri was evoked accidentally multiple times during interviews. The third one is search history. It is a popular feature within my participants, but only Google assistant does it really well. </p>

              <h3>Competitive Analysis </h3>
              <p>In order to construct a concise and solid foundation for "Jessica", I had to venture out and see what the virtual assistant applications were already doing and what user goals they were not reaching. I evaluated several features deemed vital from user surveys and identified which ones "Jessica" could capitalize on to have a leg up over other applications. I found that only one of the three main competitors offer search history and text assisting features for users. Even then, Google assistant's search history feature is very limited. Last, all of them lack data transparency which is a major concern during my survey findings among users.</p>

        <div class="ia">
               <h3>Information architecture</h3>
               <p>Based on my previously findings it is time to build Information architecture. Information architecture is a crucial step in my design process, it presents a backbone of design. Navigation and visual design are built based on the IA, and in order to create a hierarchy, the IA needs to consider both what the user expects to see (based on research) as well as how the business wants to show the information (based on project requirements).</p>

        <div class="wireflow">
               <h3>Wireflow</h3>
               <p>I sketched a few ideas about the arrangement of UI, functional and data elements, and interactive behaviors, and because there are not too many core features to consider in this project, I decided to use wireflow instead of making wireframes to document how users would interact with the app in common task flows.   </p>

         <div class="takeaways">
                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>More and more voice-controlled devices, such as the Apple HomePod, Google Home, and Amazon Echo, are storming the market. Voice user interfaces are helping to improve all kinds of different user experiences, and some believe that voice will power 50% of all searches by 2020. But It's challenging to me that designing something I don't use too often, meaning I have to really rely on thorough user research to understand the problem. I got to experiment with the Adobe XD prototype tool and auto animation in the design process. Also, it's challenging to design a product that engenders your user's trust. I will be further exploring how good design can create trust and feelings of positivity in users.</p>
